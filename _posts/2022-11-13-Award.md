We are happy to announce that Unicorn Engine was awarded by Alibaba Cloud for its impact on the cybersecurity field (and beyond since our project is widely used for other purposes, too)!

Unicorn Engine was created and released more than 7 years ago to the public. We launched Unicorn Engine under an open-source license with the goal of contributing to the community and helping as many people as possible with our code. Our team has worked hard to maintain and develop the project to its full potential. We are pleased to see Unicorn Engine becoming a de facto emulator and laying the foundation for various innovative works in academia and industry.

We want to thank the whole community for your continuous support over the years. This recognition is for all of us!
